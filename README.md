# Infix2Postfix

Class Assignment. Converts infix expressions from a file "input" into postfix and writes the postfix and its evaluation into a file "output".

The Infix2Postfix.java is built on top of the Stack.java and Queue.java which are both built on the List.java, all original code not using Java's built-in classes for these data structures.
